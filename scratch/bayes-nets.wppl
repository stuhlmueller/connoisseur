// Model 1


// **generate data**
// this needs a prior on x (which we don't need for inference since x is always observed)


// infer:
// sample params to be learned, generate data, then do some kind of
// comparison, using a score or an error function

// shared functions across generate data and infer
// u(x), b(u(x))
